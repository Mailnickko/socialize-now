# Team Meerkats' Thesis Project #

## Summary ##

  Icebreaker provides the spark your group needs to break the ice. Building and maintaining friendships is hard. Maybe you've recently moved, or joined a new group. Maybe you've known your group for years, but always do the same thing. Sometimes all you need is a good idea to get things going. The problem is that it's hard to develop an idea that makes everybody happy.

  Our algorithm recommends activities your group might enjoy. Then we facilitate polls so you can choose the activity that fits your group the best. Finally, we provide a virtual bulletin board to post details, photos, and comments so you can coordinate and commemorate.

## Problem ##
